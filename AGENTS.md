# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `main.go` bootstraps CLI, wires config/git/ui packages, handles signals.
- `git/` holds git interactions (staged states, diffs). Keep Go packages focused on repository IO.
- `ui/` contains tview-based widgets, diff views, tests like `split_view_content_test.go`. Use this folder for UI logic only.
- `config/` resolves runtime paths (e.g., `gitta_selected.patch`) and should stay side-effect free.
- `util/` groups terminal helpers (`color.go`, `file_reader.go`); favor small, stateless helpers.
- `docs/images/` stores assets such as `gitta_demo.gif`; generated binaries go to repo root (`gitta`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `go build -o gitta ./...` compiles the TUI binary; run from repo root to mirror release builds.
- `go run . --watch` runs the app with auto-refresh to test staging workflows end-to-end.
- `go test ./...` runs all package tests, including UI rendering helpers.
- `go test ./ui -run DiffView` focuses on UI-specific test suites when iterating.
- `go fmt ./...` and `go vet ./...` keep the codebase idiomatic; run before sending changes.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Follow standard Go style: tabs for indentation, CamelCase for exported types, lowercaseCamel for unexported.
- Keep packages cohesive; prefer file names aligned with the main type (`diff_view.go` â†’ `DiffView`).
- Use descriptive command constants and key handlers that match existing `ui/*.go` patterns.
- Rely on `gofmt`; avoid manual alignment. When introducing config keys, mirror the `LoadConfig` getter style.

## Testing Guidelines
- Prefer table-driven tests as seen in `ui/utils_test.go`.
- Name test files with `_test.go` and functions `TestXxx`. For behavior toggles, assert both staged and unstaged flows.
- Execute `go test ./...` prior to PRs; add `-cover` when touching core flow to ensure diff calculations stay above existing coverage.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Maintain concise Conventional Commit prefixes observed in history (`fix:`, `add:`, `refactor:`). Use present tense.
- Scope commits narrowly: UI tweaks vs git plumbing should land separately with clear context.
- PRs should include: summary of behavior change, reproduction or test commands, and screenshots/GIFs for UI updates (reuse `docs/images/` when appropriate).
- Link tracking issues and mention follow-up tasks explicitly; note any manual QA steps performed.

## Configuration & Debugging Notes
- Respect `config.AppConfig` and the `gitta_selected.patch` temp file; clean up temp artifacts in teardown logic.
- Use the `--debug` flag to emit logs into `tmp/` when diagnosing selection errors; avoid committing debug output.
